# Initial  Adversarial Playground Setup
# Use "adversarial_playground_ai_target" machine for this practice

This chapter takes you on a step-by-step journey to build a complete machine learning (ML) pipeline—from setting up your development environment to deploying an inference service. By the end of the chapter, you will have developed a simple AI service, learned essential ML techniques, and explored scaling ML development on the cloud.




Below is a detailed explanation of each file and directory in your this folder, which is organized to support the activities covered :


### File and Directory Breakdown

- **Dockerfile**  
  Contains instructions to build a Docker container. This file defines the environment (dependencies, configurations, etc.) necessary to run your ML project reproducibly on any system.

- **aws (Directory)**  
  Contains AWS-specific resources. This folder might include configuration files or scripts that help you deploy or manage your ML environment on Amazon Web Services.

- **chapter2.md**  
  A Markdown file that likely provides a summary or detailed documentation of Chapter 2. It may serve as a study guide or reference, outlining the key concepts and steps covered in the chapter.

- **basic-ml.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates basic machine learning concepts using a dataset (for example, the wine dataset). It includes data exploration, model training (e.g., decision trees, random forests), and evaluation techniques.

- **deployed_models (Directory)**  
  A folder where trained model files are stored after deployment. For instance, once you train your CNN, the saved model might be moved here to keep track of different versions or backups.

- **images (Directory)**  
  Contains sample images used to test the deployed ML model. These images can be fed into the inference service to check how well the model performs on real-world examples.

- **inference_service.py**  
  A Python script that runs a Flask-based REST API for model inference. When executed, it starts a server that accepts image inputs, processes them through the trained model, and returns predictions.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists all the Python libraries (and their versions) that are needed for the project. Running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtual environment will ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed.

- **simple-cnn-cifar10.h5**  
  The saved model file (in HDF5 format) for your Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This file is loaded by the inference service to make predictions on new images.

- **simple-cnn-cifar10.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that details the process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes all the steps from data preprocessing and model design to training and performance evaluation.

- **test_client.py**  
  A Python script that acts as a client to test the REST API provided by `inference_service.py`. By running this script with a sample image path as an argument, you can send a request to the inference service and view the prediction results.

### How These Files Work Together

- **Environment Setup & Dependencies:**  
  The **Dockerfile**, **requirements.txt**, and AWS folder help ensure your development environment is consistent and scalable, whether you're running locally or on the cloud.

- **Model Development:**  
  The notebooks (**basic-ml.ipynb** and **simple-cnn-cifar10.ipynb**) guide you through different ML techniques—from basic algorithms to advanced deep learning using CNNs. They also show how to preprocess data and evaluate model performance.

- **Model Deployment & Inference:**  
  Once the CNN is trained (saved as **simple-cnn-cifar10.h5**), it is deployed as a REST API using **inference_service.py**. You can test this service using **test_client.py** with images provided in the **images** directory.

- **Documentation & Backup:**  
  The **chapter2.md** file serves as a detailed reference for Chapter 2, and having backup files like **Dockerfile copy** helps preserve earlier configurations.

This structure provides a full cycle—from environment setup and model training to deployment and testing—which is essential for building and defending against adversarial AI attacks. This breakdown should help you understand how each component contributes to the overall project workflow.


## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Python Installation
- **Overview:**  
  Learn to install Python on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
- **Windows Users:**  
  Use the official Python installer and consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) with Ubuntu 20.04 for a more Linux-like experience.  
- **macOS & Linux Users:**  
  While macOS may include an older version, it is recommended to install the latest Python version using Homebrew (macOS) or the distribution’s package manager (Linux).

### Creating a Virtual Environment
- **Purpose:**  
  Isolate project dependencies from your system installation.
- **Tool Used:**  
  Python’s built-in `venv`.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory (e.g., `adversarial-ai`).
  2. Create the virtual environment using:  
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     ```
  3. Activate the virtual environment:  
     - **Linux/macOS:** `source .venv/bin/activate`  
     - **Windows:** `.venv\Scripts\activate`
  4. Verify the environment by running:  
     ```bash
     pip list
     ```
     This will show only the essential packages, such as pip and setuptools.

### Installing Required Packages
- **Method 1: Command-Line Installation**  
  Install packages like pandas and matplotlib individually:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib
  ```
- **Method 2: Using `requirements.txt`**  
  Create a `requirements.txt` file listing required libraries and versions:
  ```txt
  numpy==1.22.4
  matplotlib==3.5.2
  pandas==1.4.3
  scikit-learn==1.1.2
  Pillow==9.2.0
  tensorflow==2.9.1
  ipykernel
  flask
  ```
  Install all packages with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Integrating with Jupyter Notebooks
- **Register Virtual Environment as a Kernel:**  
  This ensures that the Jupyter Notebook uses the correct environment:
  ```bash
  python -m ipykernel install --user --name=secure-ai --display-name="Secure AI"
  ```
- **Verification:**  
  Run `jupyter notebook`, open the provided notebooks (e.g., `verify-environment.ipynb`), and select the "Secure AI" kernel.

## 2. Hands-on Basic Baseline Machine Learning

### Exploring the Wine Dataset
- **Dataset Overview:**  
  The Wine dataset (from scikit-learn) contains 13 attributes and a target class (Class_1, Class_2, Class_3).
- **Data Exploration:**  
  Load the dataset, convert it to a pandas DataFrame, and preview the data. Key actions include:
  - Printing feature names.
  - Displaying target labels and target names.
  - Previewing data using `df.head()`.

### Building Baseline Models
- **Decision Tree Classifier:**  
  - **Training:** Use `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn.
  - **Evaluation:** Predict on test data and compute accuracy.
- **Random Forest Classifier:**  
  - **Ensemble Learning:** Utilize multiple decision trees to avoid overfitting.
  - **Performance:** Typically offers better generalization and higher accuracy than a single decision tree.
- **Evaluation Techniques:**  
  - Compute accuracy scores.
  - Use a confusion matrix to understand model misclassifications.

## 3. Developing an Advanced AI Service with CNNs

### Working with the CIFAR-10 Dataset
- **Dataset Overview:**  
  CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.
- **Data Collection:**  
  Retrieve and split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization:**  
  Scale image pixel values to the [0, 1] range by dividing by 255.
- **One-Hot Encoding:**  
  Transform numeric target labels into categorical format using one-hot encoding.

### Constructing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Architecture Design:**  
  Build a CNN with the following components:
  - **Convolutional Layers:** For feature extraction.
  - **Pooling Layers:** (e.g., MaxPooling2D) to reduce spatial dimensions and noise.
  - **Batch Normalization:** To stabilize and accelerate training.
  - **Dropout Layers:** For regularization and preventing overfitting.
  - **Fully Connected Layers:** Flatten the output and classify using a softmax activation.
- **Compilation and Training:**  
  - Compile the model with `adam` optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` loss.
  - Train the model with appropriate hyperparameters (e.g., batch size and epochs).
  - Monitor training and validation accuracy for convergence.
- **Saving the Model:**  
  Once converged, save the trained model for future inference.

### Deploying the CNN as an AI Service
- **Model Inference Service:**  
  - Create a Flask-based REST API.
  - The service resizes incoming images, uses the CNN model for prediction, and returns the class label.
- **Testing the Service:**  
  - Run the inference service and test it using a sample client script (`test_client.py`).
  - Validate predictions using example images (e.g., images of a dog or automobile).
