## Security Fundamentals

### The CIA Triad

Security revolves around three core principles:

- **Confidentiality:**  
  - Protect data from unauthorized access.
  - Techniques include access restrictions and data encryption.

- **Integrity:**  
  - Ensure data remains unchanged except by authorized actions.
  - Methods include using cryptographic hash functions to verify data integrity.

- **Availability:**  
  - Guarantee that systems and data are accessible when needed.
  - Techniques such as load balancing and redundancy help maintain availability during peak loads or system failures.

### Security Frameworks

Organizations often adhere to standardized frameworks to manage cybersecurity risks. Some of these include:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**  
  - Comprises five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

- **Other Frameworks and Standards:**  
  - ISACA Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT)
  - CIS Critical Security Controls
  - System and Organization Controls 2 (SOC2)
  - Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)

## Threat Modeling

### What is Threat Modeling?

Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and managing potential threats to a system. It involves:

- **Identifying Critical Assets:**  
  - Recognizing the most valuable components, processes, and data flows within a system.

- **Defining Trust Boundaries:**  
  - Establishing areas of trust and concern to pinpoint where threats might occur.

### Popular Threat Modeling Approaches

- **STRIDE:**  
  - A model that categorizes threats into:
    - **Spoofing:** Impersonation of users or systems.
    - **Tampering:** Unauthorized alteration of data.
    - **Repudiation:** Denial of actions without proof.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to data.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disruption of service availability.
    - **Elevation of Privilege:** Gaining unauthorized access to higher-level permissions.

- **Attack Trees:**  
  - Visual representations of the paths an attacker might take.
  - Each node represents a specific action leading toward a potential compromise.
  - **MITRE ATT&CK:** Provides a standardized vocabulary for attack techniques.
  - **MITRE ATLAS:** A newer framework specifically designed for AI adversarial attacks.

For further reading, explore resources on threat modeling and the MITRE frameworks.

# Securing Our Adversarial Playground

In this section, we highlight key security concerns in AI/ML development and explain practical steps to secure the deployment of the image recognition service (ImRecS) developed in the previous chapter. Our goal is to demonstrate security concepts and techniques rather than provide a production-ready blueprint.

---

## Overview

- **ImRecS:**  
  Our image recognition service built with a pre-trained CIFAR-10 CNN.
  
- **Deployment Architecture:**  
  - A simple web app is provided to browse and upload images to test the ImRecS API.  
  - The overall system is packaged into Docker containers running on a Linux host.  
  - Figures (not shown here) illustrate the web app interface and the high-level architecture of the adversarial AI playground.

- **Demo Environment:**  
  While we assume your development computer acts as the deployment host, you can also experiment with a separate VM or cloud environment (AWS, Azure).

---

## Host Security

### Basic Assumptions

- **Demo Environment:**  
  For this demonstration, the host is secured with basic measures—a firewall, strong passwords, and antivirus protection. For more critical deployments, further hardening is necessary.

### Baseline Host Security Measures

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Keep the operating system and software up-to-date:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```
  Enable automatic security updates.

- **Minimal Software:**  
  - Install only necessary software to reduce the attack surface.  
  - Consider using distroless OS images in your containers to eliminate unneeded packages.  
  - Regularly review and remove any unused software.

### User Access Control

- **Password Policy:**  
  Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
  
- **Account Management:**  
  - Disable the root account and use `sudo` for administrative tasks.
  - Regularly review user accounts and disable or remove those no longer needed.

### Firewall Configuration

- **Port Restrictions:**  
  Use tools like Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) to allow only necessary ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
  
- **Regular Review:**  
  Periodically update firewall rules to reflect any changes in your services.

### Container Security

- **Trusted Runtime:**  
  Use Docker or containerd and keep your container runtime and images updated.
  
- **Isolation and Capabilities:**  
  - Use user namespaces for container isolation.
  - Limit container capabilities with flags like `--cap-drop`.
  
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**  
  Use a signed SBOM to audit and verify container contents.

### System Monitoring and Auditing

- **Monitoring Tools:**  
  - Use `auditd` to monitor system calls.
  - Set up log monitoring and alerting with tools like Logwatch or Fail2ban.
  
- **Log Review:**  
  Regularly review system and application logs for suspicious activities.

### Backup and Recovery

- **Regular Backups:**  
  - Schedule backups for critical data.
  - Store backups in a secure, off-site location.
  - Periodically test backup restores to ensure data integrity.

### Disabling Unused Network Services

- **Service Audit:**  
  Use `netstat -tuln` to list listening services and disable any that are unnecessary.

### Securing SSH Access

- **SSH Best Practices:**  
  - Use SSH keys instead of passwords.
  - Disable root login over SSH.
  - Change the default SSH port.
  - Employ tools like Fail2ban to block repeated failed login attempts.

### Endpoint Security and Vulnerability Management

- **Endpoint Protection:**  
  Use solutions such as ClamAV for malware detection, Lynis for security auditing, OSSEC for host-based intrusion detection, AIDE for file integrity monitoring, and rkhunter for rootkit detection.

- **Patch Management:**  
  Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and promptly apply security patches to the OS, applications, and services.

---

## Network Protection

### Minimizing the Attack Surface

- **Exposure Control:**  
  Only expose services that are absolutely necessary. For ImRecS, this means restricting access to internal API endpoints.

### Enforcing TLS/SSL

- **Certificate Generation:**  
  Generate a TLS/SSL certificate and key using OpenSSL to encrypt communications:
  ```bash
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout "$SSL_DIR/service_key.pem" -out "$SSL_DIR/service_cert.pem" -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=GB/ST=Greater London/L=London/O=AISolutions/OU=ML/CN=localhost"
  ```
  A bash script automates this process, storing the files in an `ssl` folder.

### Using an NGINX Proxy Container

- **Proxy Configuration:**  
  An NGINX container enforces HTTPS and acts as an API gateway.
  
- **Key Functions:**
  - **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection:**
    ```nginx
    server {
      listen 80;
      location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
      }
    }
    ```
  - **TLS Configuration & Endpoint Mapping:**
    ```nginx
    server {
      listen 443 ssl;
      ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/service_cert.pem;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/service_key.pem;
      ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
      
      # Publicly accessible status endpoints
      location /status/app {
        proxy_pass http://service_app/heartbeat;
      }
      location /status/api {
        proxy_pass http://service_api/heartbeat;
      }
      
      # Deny direct access to service_api
      location ~ ^/(?!status/api).*$ {
        deny all;
      }
      
      # Handle all other requests with rate limiting
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://service_app;
        limit_req zone=one burst=5;
      }
    }
    
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s;
    ```
  
- **Docker Compose Integration:**
  Mount the SSL folder and NGINX configuration in your Docker Compose file:
  ```yaml
  services:
    proxy:
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - "80:80"
        - "443:443"
      volumes:
        - ./proxy/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
      depends_on:
        - service_app
  ```
  
- **Host Firewall:**  
  Apply firewall rules to block incoming traffic to internal service ports (e.g., 8000 and 5000).

---

## Authentication and Access Control

### OAuth2 Authentication with GitHub

- **Purpose:**  
  Prevent abuse by ensuring only authorized users access the web app.
  
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. **Register on GitHub:** Obtain your client ID and client secret.
  2. **Integrate OAuth2:** Use a Flask extension such as Flask-OAuthlib to handle OAuth2 authentication. When users access the app, they are redirected to GitHub for login.
  
- **Example Code:**
  ```python
  from flask_oauthlib.client import OAuth
  oauth = OAuth(app)
  
  github = oauth.remote_app(
      'github',
      consumer_key='YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID',
      consumer_secret='YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET',
      request_token_params={'scope': 'user:email'},
      base_url='https://api.github.com/',
      request_token_url=None,
      access_token_method='POST',
      access_token_url='https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token',
      authorize_url='https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize'
  )
  ```

### API Key Protection

- **Defense in Depth:**  
  Alongside OAuth2 for user access, secure internal API communication with API keys.
  
- **Implementation:**
  - **Generate a Secure API Key:** Store it securely in both the `service_app` and `service_api`.
  - **Include the API Key in Requests:**
    ```python
    # In service_app
    headers = {'API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'}
    response = requests.post(f"{FLASK_API_URL}/predict", files={'file': image}, headers=headers)
    
    # In service_api
    api_key = request.headers.get('API-Key')
    if api_key != 'YOUR_API_KEY':
        return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized'}), 401
    ```
  This ensures that even if network protections are bypassed, unauthorized API requests will be rejected.

---

## Final Thoughts

- **Not a Production Blueprint:**  
  The techniques presented are meant for demonstration and learning. In production, additional measures (e.g., secrets management, advanced monitoring) should be implemented.

- **Defense in Depth:**  
  By applying multiple layers of security—from host hardening and container isolation to network protection and robust authentication—you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential adversarial attacks.

- **Adaptability:**  
  These recommendations can be adapted based on your deployment environment, whether it’s on-premises, a dedicated VM, or a cloud platform like AWS or Azure.

# Data Protection and Secure Artifact Management in Adversarial AI



## 1. Data Protection

### 1.1 Securing Data in Transit

- **TLS Enforcement:**  
  Data is secured while in transit by enforcing TLS 1.2. This prevents attackers from snooping on sensitive data by intercepting traffic.

### 1.2 Securing Data at Rest

Even when data is stored, it must be protected from unauthorized access or tampering. For our adversarial AI playground, our trained model is considered sensitive and must be shielded using encryption and integrity controls.

#### Encryption

- **Objective:**  
  Protect the trained model (and any other sensitive data) using strong encryption so that even if an attacker bypasses network or access controls, they cannot read or tamper with the data.

- **Implementation with AES-256-GCM:**

  - **Key Generation:**  
    Use OpenSSL to generate a 256-bit key:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -hex 32 > keys/aes256.key
    ```
  
  - **Encryption Function:**  
    A Python function using the `cryptography` module to encrypt data:
    ```python
    def encrypt(data, key):
        nonce = os.urandom(12)
        cipher = algorithms.AES(key)
        mode = modes.GCM(nonce)
        encryptor = default_backend().create_symmetric_encryption_ctx(cipher, mode)
        encrypted_data = encryptor.update(data) + encryptor.finalize()
        return nonce + encrypted_data
    ```
  
  - **Docker Integration:**  
    The `keys` folder is mounted as a volume in the Docker Compose file so that the encryption key is available at runtime:
    ```yaml
    service_api:
      build: ./service_api
      ports:
        - "5000:5000"
      volumes:
        - .keys:/keys
        - ./api/deployed_models:/deployed_models
    ```

- **Decryption at Runtime:**  
  The model file is decrypted before being loaded:
  ```python
  # Load the AES key
  with open('/path/to/mounted/keys/service.key', 'rb') as key_file:
      AES_KEY = key_file.read()

  # Get the model path from the environment variable
  MODEL_PATH = os.environ.get('MODEL_PATH')
  if not MODEL_PATH:
      raise ValueError("MODEL_PATH environment variable is not set!")

  # Load and decrypt the model
  with open(MODEL_PATH, 'rb') as model_file:
      encrypted_model_data = model_file.read()
  decrypted_model_data = decrypt(encrypted_model_data, AES_KEY)
  model = tf.keras.models.load_model(io.BytesIO(decrypted_model_data))
  ```

#### Integrity Control

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensure that the encrypted model has not been tampered with.

- **Using SHA-256 Hashing:**

  - **Generating a Hash:**  
    Generate a SHA-256 hash for your encrypted model file:
    ```bash
    openssl dgst -sha256 deployed_models/model.enc
    ```
  
  - **Runtime Verification:**  
    Compare the computed hash with an expected hash provided as an environment variable:
    ```python
    computed_hash = hashlib.sha256(encrypted_model_data).hexdigest()
    expected_hash = os.environ.get('MODEL_HASH')
    if not expected_hash:
        raise ValueError("MODEL_HASH environment variable is not set!")
    if computed_hash != expected_hash:
        send_alert_email()
        raise ValueError("The model file has been tampered with!")
    ```
  
- **Alternatives:**  
  You might also consider digital signatures or HMAC-based checksums for integrity verification.

### 1.3 Access Control for Sensitive Data

- **Objective:**  
  Ensure that only authorized users or processes can access encryption keys, models, and other sensitive artifacts.

- **Implementing Least-Privilege via Linux Permissions:**

  1. **Create a Group for ML Operations:**
     ```bash
     sudo groupadd ml-ops
     ```
  
  2. **Add Users to the Group:**  
     For example, creating a sudo-enabled admin and a non-sudo ML engineer:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd admin
     sudo usermod -aG sudo admin
     sudo usermod -aG ml-ops admin

     sudo useradd adam
     sudo usermod -aG ml-ops adam
     ```
  
  3. **Restrict Folder Permissions:**  
     Limit write access on sensitive folders:
     ```bash
     sudo chown :ml-ops keys ssl deployed_models
     sudo chmod 770 keys ssl deployed_models
     ```
  
  4. **Service Account for API:**  
     Create and use a dedicated service account for running the API:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd service-api-user
     ```
     Configure the Docker Compose file to run the `service_api` container as this user:
     ```yaml
     services:
       service_api:
         image: service_api
         user: service-api-user
         ...
     ```
  
  5. **Further Restrict Access:**  
     Set permissions so that only the service account and group members can access the keys and models:
     ```bash
     sudo chown service-api-user:ml-ops keys deployed_models
     sudo chmod 750 keys deployed_models
     ```
  
  6. **Securing the SSL Folder for the NGINX Proxy:**  
     Create a dedicated proxy user and restrict access:
     ```bash
     sudo useradd proxy-user
     sudo chown proxy-user:ml-ops ssl
     sudo chmod 750 ssl
     ```

---

## 2. Securing Code and Artifacts

AI projects introduce unique artifacts—such as trained models—that are critical and sensitive. Securing these assets requires not only traditional code security practices but also specialized measures for AI-related files.

### 2.1 Secure Source Code

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  
  Use tools like **Bandit** to scan Python code for common security issues:
  ```bash
  pip install bandit
  bandit -r .
  ```

### 2.2 Vulnerability Scanning for Dependencies

- **Component Analysis:**  
  Use **Trivy** to scan your project and container images for vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  trivy fs .
  trivy image <YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:TAG>
  ```
- **Remediation:**  
  Address reported vulnerabilities—such as updating vulnerable libraries (e.g., updating the Pillow version in `requirements.txt`).

### 2.3 Secret Scanning

- **Avoid Leaking Secrets:**  
  Ensure that sensitive information (API keys, private keys) is excluded from source code repositories using `.gitignore` and dedicated secret management solutions.
- **Reference:**  
  OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet:  
  [OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)

### 2.4 Securing Jupyter Notebooks

- **Notebook Vulnerability:**  
  Jupyter Notebooks can include inline code (magic commands) that install packages not covered by dependency scans.
  
- **Conversion & Scanning:**  
  Convert notebooks to Python scripts and scan with Bandit:
  ```bash
  jupyter nbconvert --to script YourNotebook.ipynb
  bandit -r YourNotebook.py
  ```
  
- **NBDefense:**  
  Use NBDefense to scan notebooks for vulnerabilities and PII:
  ```bash
  pip install nbdefense
  nbdefense scan -r notebooks
  ```

### 2.5 Securing Models from Malicious Code

- **Serialization Risks:**  
  Serialized models (especially those using insecure methods like Python’s pickle) can be exploited to execute malicious code.
  
- **Safer Alternatives:**  
  Use Keras’ H5 format or frameworks like Safetensors for model serialization.
  
- **Model Scanning:**  
  Employ tools like **ModelScan** to inspect model files:
  ```bash
  pip install modelscan
  modelscan -p models
  ```

---

## 3. Bypassing Security with Adversarial AI

Even when traditional security measures protect the deployment environment and artifacts, adversarial AI attacks can target the core logic of the model itself.

### 3.1 Overview of Adversarial Attacks

- **Challenge:**  
  While firewalls, encryption, and access controls safeguard infrastructure and artifacts, they do not defend the ML model's decision logic.
  
- **Evasion Attacks:**  
  Attackers introduce imperceptible perturbations to input images (or other data) to mislead the model into misclassification.

### 3.2 Our First Adversarial AI Attack

- **Scenario:**  
  Imagine the ImRecS system is designed to detect airplanes. An attacker crafts an image that looks like an airplane to a human, but due to subtle perturbations, the model misclassifies it as a bird.
  
- **Process:**  
  The adversary uses gradient-based techniques (similar to gradient descent) and tools like the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox to generate these perturbations.
  
- **Real-World Examples:**  
  Research has demonstrated similar techniques on smart car systems—such as applying small pieces of tape to a stop sign to fool facial recognition or autonomous driving systems.

### 3.3 Traditional Cybersecurity vs. Adversarial AI

- **Traditional Cybersecurity:**  
  Focuses on protecting networks, systems, and data through reactive measures based on known vulnerabilities.
  
- **Adversarial AI:**  
  Adversarial attacks treat model inputs as an optimization problem, dynamically adapting to fool models in ways that signature-based defenses cannot detect.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  Adversarial robustness must be incorporated into AI security practices, complementing traditional methods to defend against these sophisticated attacks.

---

## 4. Summary

- **Data Protection:**  
  - Encrypt sensitive assets (such as trained models) using AES-256-GCM.
  - Ensure integrity with SHA-256 hashing and verify data before use.
  - Enforce least-privilege access through proper user and file permission management.

- **Securing Code and Artifacts:**  
  - Employ static analysis (Bandit) and dependency vulnerability scanning (Trivy) to secure your source code and third-party libraries.
  - Scan notebooks and model files to detect secret leaks and potential malicious code.

- **Adversarial AI Threats:**  
  - Traditional security measures are effective in safeguarding infrastructure and artifacts but fall short against adversarial attacks targeting model logic.
  - Incorporate adversarial robustness into your security strategy to mitigate evasion and other adversarial threats.

- **Next Steps:**  
  In production environments, consider integrating these security measures into automated DevSecOps/MLOps pipelines and using dedicated key management and secret storage solutions (e.g., Docker Secrets, AWS KMS, Hashicorp Vault).
