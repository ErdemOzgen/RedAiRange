## Introduction to Generative AI

- **Definition:**  
  Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that **generates new content** by learning from existing datasets. Unlike AI models designed solely for analysis or classification, generative models create data that resembles the training distribution.

- **Key Differences:**  
  - **Predictive/Discriminative Models:**  
    - Focus on classifying, predicting, or estimating continuous values.
    - Examples include regression and classification models.
  - **Generative Models:**  
    - Create new data samples by learning patterns, styles, or features.
    - Estimate multiple values simultaneously to generate novel outputs.

- **Applications:**  
  - Art and design
  - Content creation (text, images, videos)
  - Data augmentation for machine learning
  - Deepfakes and adversarial attacks

## History and Evolution

- **Early Models:**  
  - Began with simple models in the early 2000s capable of generating basic patterns or sequences.

- **Deep Learning Breakthrough:**  
  - The advent of deep neural networks expanded the capabilities of generative models.

- **Introduction of GANs:**  
  - **2014:** Ian Goodfellow and colleagues introduced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), marking a significant milestone.
  - GANs opened new avenues in realistic image generation, data augmentation, and more.

- **Subsequent Techniques:**  
  - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Generate new data by sampling from a latent space.
  - **Transformer Models:** Pioneered by models like GPT-3, these are now essential for text generation.
  - **Diffusion Models:** Generate high-quality images by reversing a noise-addition process.

## Core Technologies in Generative AI

Generative AI comprises several key methodologies:

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**  
  Use a generator–discriminator pair in a competitive setting to produce realistic outputs.

- **Auto-Encoders & Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**  
  Compress input data and reconstruct it; VAEs generate new data by sampling from learned latent spaces.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & Sequence Models:**  
  Useful for sequence generation in tasks such as text generation and music composition.

- **Transformer Models:**  
  Enable parallel processing of sequences and are the basis of large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.

- **Diffusion Models:**  
  Start with noise and iteratively refine the output, producing high-quality images.

- **Energy-Based Models (EBMs) & Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs):**  
  Utilize principles from physics to model data distributions.

- **Emerging Models:**  
  PixelRNNs, PixelCNNs, and flow-based models continue to push the boundaries.

## Deep Dive into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

### GAN Architecture

- **Generator:**  
  Creates new data instances (e.g., images) from a random latent vector. The goal is to produce outputs that are indistinguishable from real data.

- **Discriminator:**  
  Evaluates data to determine whether it is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated). It acts as a binary classifier.

- **Training Process:**  
  1. **Generator** produces a sample.
  2. **Discriminator** evaluates both real and generated samples.
  3. Both networks update their weights based on a loss function. The generator is rewarded when it fools the discriminator, and the discriminator is rewarded for correctly classifying the samples.

### Step-by-Step GAN Implementation

Below is a simplified code-level example using the Keras API with the CIFAR-10 dataset.

#### 1. Collect and Prepare Real Data

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
import numpy as np

def load_real_samples():
    # Load CIFAR-10 dataset
    (trainX, _), (_, _) = cifar10.load_data()
    # Convert from unsigned ints to floats
    X = trainX.astype('float32')
    # Scale from [0,255] to [-1,1]
    X = (X - 127.5) / 127.5
    return X
```

#### 2. Create the Generator Network

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Reshape, Conv2DTranspose, LeakyReLU, Conv2D

def build_generator(latent_dim):
    model = Sequential()
    n_nodes = 256 * 4 * 4
    model.add(Dense(n_nodes, input_dim=latent_dim))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Reshape((4, 4, 256)))
    # Upsample to 8x8
    model.add(Conv2DTranspose(128, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same'))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    # Upsample to 16x16
    model.add(Conv2DTranspose(128, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same'))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    # Upsample to 32x32
    model.add(Conv2DTranspose(128, (4,4), strides=(2,2), padding='same'))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    # Final layer: generate 32x32 image with 3 channels (RGB)
    model.add(Conv2D(3, (3,3), activation='tanh', padding='same'))
    return model
```

#### 3. Create the Discriminator Network

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Flatten, Dropout, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def build_discriminator(in_shape=(32,32,3)):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), padding='same', input_shape=in_shape))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same'))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same'))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Conv2D(256, (3,3), strides=(2,2), padding='same'))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dropout(0.4))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    
    opt = Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5)
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=opt, metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

#### 4. Build the Composite GAN Model

```python
def build_gan(generator, discriminator):
    # Freeze the discriminator weights during generator training
    discriminator.trainable = False
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(generator)
    model.add(discriminator)
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(lr=0.0002, beta_1=0.5))
    return model
```

#### 5. Training Loop

The training process involves:
- Splitting each batch into real and fake samples.
- Training the discriminator with real images (labeled as 1) and generated images (labeled as 0).
- Training the generator via the composite model with the goal of producing images that fool the discriminator (labels flipped to 1).

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.random import randint, randn, ones, zeros

def generate_latent_points(latent_dim, n_samples):
    x_input = randn(latent_dim * n_samples)
    x_input = x_input.reshape(n_samples, latent_dim)
    return x_input

def generate_real_samples(dataset, n_samples):
    ix = randint(0, dataset.shape[0], n_samples)
    X = dataset[ix]
    y = ones((n_samples, 1))
    return X, y

def generate_fake_samples(generator, latent_dim, n_samples):
    x_input = generate_latent_points(latent_dim, n_samples)
    X = generator.predict(x_input)
    y = zeros((n_samples, 1))
    return X, y

def train_discriminator(discriminator, generator, dataset, latent_dim, batch_size):
    half_batch = int(batch_size / 2)
    X_real, y_real = generate_real_samples(dataset, half_batch)
    d_loss1, _ = discriminator.train_on_batch(X_real, y_real)
    X_fake, y_fake = generate_fake_samples(generator, latent_dim, half_batch)
    d_loss2, _ = discriminator.train_on_batch(X_fake, y_fake)
    return d_loss1, d_loss2

def train_gan(generator, discriminator, gan_model, dataset, latent_dim, n_epochs=200, batch_size=128):
    batches_per_epoch = int(dataset.shape[0] / batch_size)
    for i in range(n_epochs):
        for j in range(batches_per_epoch):
            d_loss1, d_loss2 = train_discriminator(discriminator, generator, dataset, latent_dim, batch_size)
            # Train the generator (through the composite model)
            x_gan = generate_latent_points(latent_dim, batch_size)
            y_gan = ones((batch_size, 1))
            g_loss = gan_model.train_on_batch(x_gan, y_gan)
            print(f'Epoch {i+1}, Batch {j+1}/{batches_per_epoch} -> d1={d_loss1:.3f}, d2={d_loss2:.3f}, g={g_loss:.3f}')
        # Optionally, save generated images and model checkpoints at intervals
```

#### 6. Putting It All Together

```python
# Load data, create models, and start training
dataset = load_real_samples()
latent_dim = 100

generator = build_generator(latent_dim)
discriminator = build_discriminator()
gan_model = build_gan(generator, discriminator)

train_gan(generator, discriminator, gan_model, dataset, latent_dim)
```

## Advanced Techniques: WGANs and Custom Loss Functions

Plain GANs may suffer from training instability or mode collapse. **Wasserstein GANs (WGANs)** mitigate these issues by:

- Using the **Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD)** as a loss metric.
- Adjusting labels to -1 (fake) and 1 (real) to produce continuous probability scores.
- Clipping weights and handling floating-point labels.

A simple custom loss function for a WGAN can be implemented as:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def wasserstein_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return K.mean(y_true * y_pred)
```

When using this loss function, update the discriminator’s optimizer and labels accordingly.
